Bubble sort is the sorting algorithm used to arrange a list in a particular form that can be ascending, descending in numerical or lexicographical order. Bubble sort named for the smaller or larger elements to be “bubble” to the top of the list. Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm.


Recursive Bubble Sort in C
Bubble sort and Recursive bubble sort shouldn’t make too much difference.

Let’s start with understand the basics of bubble sort using recursion.

What is Recursive Bubble Sort?
Recursion word refers to the repetition with itself by using the smaller input values. This will result for the current input by applying the simple functions to the returned value.

A bubble sort can be performed in the various ways using an array, pointers, function, recursion etc. When we use recursion to perform the bubble sort, it is called Recursive Bubble Sort. Recursive function calls itself until we get the sorted data. Recursive bubble sort’s advantages and disadvantages are just like same as bubble sort. But this is good to know that what is recursive bubble sort and how we can use this.


 
As we know that, in the bubble sort we use the comparison based technique to sort an array. First we compare the two initial elements with each other and put the smaller one at the very first position. Then in the second comparison or second pass, we will starts between the position of 2 and 3 elements and same swapping will be applied in these as well is the smaller one is after the greater element.


Recursive Bubble Sort Algorithm
STEP 1: If array size is 1, then return.
STEP 2: Do One Pass of normal Bubble Sort on the given array. This will fix last element of current subarray.
STEP 3: Use Recursion for all elements except last of current subarray.
